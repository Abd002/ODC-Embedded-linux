lunix philosophy
  1-)  small is beautifull
  2-)  do one thing
  3-)  prototype a soon as possible
  4-)  choose portability than effecency
  5-)  flat file text for all programm .(doesn't matter)
  6-)  software levegee -> donn't re build 
  7-)  use script
  8-)  avoid complex -> use terminal
  9-)  make every programm a filter of another -> can use outout of another programm

terminal -> shell -> kernel 

tty2-7 -> each one has it's text -> pts

hard link -> same inode multible reference count
soft link -> new inode that has referance path to directory
